Module:   Win32::MSI::HighLevel
Version:  1.0005
Released: Sep 2009

Short description.

Win32::MSI::HighLevel provides a Perl wrapper and a degree of high level
management around the API provided by msi.dll for manipulating Windows Installer
.msi files.

This module is likely to be most useful where a template .msi file is available
that simply requires files and related entries to be updated to complete an
installer, or where an existing installer needs to be updated.

Long description

The module provides facilities to open or create an .msi file and to edit the
contents of the file:

    Tables may be imported, exported, added and removed.

    Table rows may be accessed, added, deleted and edited.

    The components of the Summary Information Stream may be accessed and edited.

Adding files to be installed is a high level operation with most of the required
table maintenance taken care of by the module. Details of adding files to
internal .cab files and management of the .cab files are wrapped up by the
module.

Although this module wraps up a significant amount of the housework required to
generate a Windows Installer, a substantial knowledge of the Windows Installer
technology is required to build an installer from scratch.

See the POD documentation for a full description of the module.
